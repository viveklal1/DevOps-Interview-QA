Terraform Providers

A Terraform provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with various APIs and services. 
Providers are responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources within different cloud platforms, services, or infrastructure tools. 
They enable Terraform to create, update, and delete resources across many different services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others.
